The goal of the KMS (Kultral Mega Store) Inventory Project was to analyze the performance of product categories, customer behavior, shipping strategies, and regional sales using historical sales data from 2009 to 2012. This analysis provides strategic insights to support decision-making in inventory management, customer segmentation, logistics, and revenue optimization.

- Bottom 3 Regions by Sales:

These regions showed weak sales performance, possibly needing targeted marketing or reevaluation.



#### Category-Specific Regional Performance

- Appliances Sales in Ontario:

Appliances showed moderate sales in Ontario, suggesting a potential for market penetration or product repositioning.


#### Customer Analysis
